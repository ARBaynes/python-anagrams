# The task I received:

Given a words.txt file containing a newline-delimited list of dictionary words, please implement the Anagrams class so that the get_anagrams() method returns all anagrams from words.txt for a given word.

Requirements:
* Optimise the code for fast retrieval
    * Not sure if I've achieved this fully yet
* Thread Safe implementation
    * I hope I've managed this! Although I may have been overcautious ahaha
* Write more tests
    * I've written one more, shall probably pop back to add in a couple more after a good rest :)

# My thoughts

I had to take a break because it's quite late, but might be back to give these another go.

1. With more time, I may attempt to build on the string sorting methods, as I feel like there could be space for a couple of other cool string manipulation functions!
2. I'd also like to implement an anagram match function on the Anagram class - If I manage to do that, then the get_anagrams class can match an anagram one-by-one, which would be more convenient for future uses of the Anagram class :)
